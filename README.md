# Urban Watch
Urban Watch is Urban Dictionary on your wrist. Search for words, view the Word of the Day, and even get the watch to pick a random word for you! Search is powered by watchOS's gesture typing system, as well as your voice, to ensure it is a quick and simple process. The layout is also very simple, meaning you can get to reading some great slang definitions in no time!
